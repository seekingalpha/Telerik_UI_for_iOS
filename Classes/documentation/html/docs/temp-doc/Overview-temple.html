**AppFeedback** enables your end-users to provide feedback inside your app by simply shaking their device or navigating to the feedback option. Once invoked, the component will automatically take a screenshot and prompt users to point to their issue and provide a comment.

The component's seamless integration with AppFeedback (a part of the Telerik Platform) allows for organizing and reviewing all feedback items, assigning those to members in your Telerik Platform workspace and responding directly to users. The end result is actionable feedback, and easy interaction between your users and team members.
