					<h1>AppFeedback: Workflow</h1>

<p>The feedback functionality is triggered on the device shake gesture. This gesture provides an easy and unobtrusive way to incorporate feedback into your application. After you shake the device, a popup with actionable items is shown on the screen.</p>

<p>The sample application consists of a single screen, displayed below.</p>

<p><img src="../images/appfeedback-sample-app-home-screen-ios.png" /></p>

<h1>Selection Popup</h1>

<p>This screen is shown on device shake.</p>

<p>It contains items for the specific actions you can perform:</p>

<ul>
<li>Submit feedback</li>
<li>View feedback</li>
<li>Settings</li>
</ul>


<p><img src="../images/appfeedback-sample-app-popup-ios.png" /></p>

<h1>Submit Feedback</h1>

<p>Tapping on this item opens a view where the user can submit feedback about the application. This view contains a screenshot of the application, taken at the time of shaking the device, as well as a prompting text.</p>

<p>The user can tap multiple times anywhere on the screenshot and leave a comment, describing what is the problem within that part of the screenshot.</p>

<p>After the user has left his comments, tapping the &ldquo;Send&rdquo; button will send all the comments to the backend.</p>

<p><strong>Note that every comment is sent as a new feedback thread to the backend.</strong></p>

<p>If a user sends feedback for the first time, a screen prompting for his name is displayed.</p>

<p>The user can also choose to send feedback anonymously.</p>

<h1>View Feedback</h1>

<p>All feedback left from that device is displayed in the Your Feedback view. It is split into three parts:</p>

<p><em>Open feedback threads, which need to be resolved from within Telerik Platform. </em>Resolved threads *All threds, both open and resolved.</p>

<p>Each item in the list has its creation date, description and its status in the lower right corner. Tapping an item leads to a details page, described below.</p>

<h1>View Feedback Details</h1>

<p>This screen is opened by tapping an item from the <strong>Your Feedback</strong> view and allows the user to examine further details about a specific feedback thread. Such details include a screenshot and a list of comments left from users within Telerik Platform, replying to that thread. The user can also add another comment to the feedback thread.</p>

<h1>Settings</h1>

<p>In case the user wants to change or view his name, he can do so by visiting the Settings screen.</p>
